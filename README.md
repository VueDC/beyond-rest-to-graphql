## Why GraphQL and not REST?

*   GraphQL is a "graph" where you can grab the entire database in a single request. With standard REST APIs, you can only grab parts of the database.
*   It is really easy to start serving - you write a thin layer over your data.

## Overview

*   It is a single endpoint
*   Easy to use

## Server Libraries

There are server liberaries for many popular libraries.

## Live Coding (GraphQL)

Great demo that shows how simple it is to get up and running

## Apollo

It manages state similar to Vuex, but way better apparently. No more pesky mutations, action, etc. Apollo takes care of everything

## Live Coding (Apollo)

Demo of using Apollo to fetch GraphQL in Vue.js

## Vue.js + Apollo

Apollo manages the data state
Vue.js manages the rendering

## Reactive Variables with Apollo

Can query based on dynamic data
Caching repeat queries

## External Data Access with GraphQL

## Real Time Updates
